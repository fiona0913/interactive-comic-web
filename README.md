## üêû **Bugs Found**

- **Issue:** Sometimes when the page loads, all images overlap each other. Users need to refresh a few times or resize the window to fix it. The image animations are not fully stable yet.

- **Question:** While the character cards help introduce Chapter 1‚Äôs characters, is there a more effective way to help readers remember the names and what the characters do?

---

## üí° **Improvement Suggestions**

- The website is still mostly visual in its interaction. It would be great to add some **music and sound interactions** to enhance engagement and fun.

---

## üîÑ **Reflection**

The developer has successfully implemented the homepage animation, Chapter 1 narrative content, and interactive character cards as core features. The overall visual and functional direction aligns well with expectations. Minor polishing is still needed for responsiveness and UX cues (e.g., adding a flip hint icon). The next priorities are completing Chapter 2 and 3 content, expanding the multi-chapter character card system, and further optimizing the mobile experience.


# ‚úÖ Client Acceptance Summary

## Completed Features
- Successfully implemented the floating animation for illustrations, enhancing the visual storytelling experience.
- Real-time progress bar on the right side accurately reflects the reader‚Äôs scroll position.
- Background music has been successfully integrated and adjusted for smoother playback.
- Website has been successfully deployed: [https://interactive-comic-web.onrender.com/](https://interactive-comic-web.onrender.com/)

## Outstanding Items
- The footer section still needs refinement in terms of information structure and function.
- Since this website serves as a demo that transforms traditional books into interactive illustration websites for novelists and publishers, the final footer should include a message inviting users to reach out if they are interested in turning a book into a similar web experience.

## Reflection
The developer achieved high-quality visual and interactive results within the timeline, and the deployed version closely aligns with the original vision. The animation and music integration notably enhanced the immersive feel.
